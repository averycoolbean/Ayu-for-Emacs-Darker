* Introduction
Refer to the original [[https://github.com/dempfi/ayu][Ayu-theme]]. It's truly an amazing set of theme and someone has to port it to Emacs eventually.

This repo currently provides 3 versions of Ayu-theme: the light, they grey & the dark. Refer to the files with correspondent
names.

* Installing

** Manual

Just copy the lisp files to your emacs config dir (ie: *~/.emacs.d*) and load them...

*Example*
#+begin_src sh
cp ayu-*.el ~/.emacs.d/themes
#+end_src

And somewhere, with a little lisp...
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-theme-directory "~/.emacs.d/themes")
#+end_src

** Quelpa

It's possible to install it using [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][Quelpa]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ayu-theme
  :quelpa
  (ayu-theme :repo "averycoolbean/Ayu-for-Emacs-Darker" :fetcher github)
  :config
  (load-theme 'ayu-dark t))
#+END_SRC

* License/Credit
All go to the original author of Ayu-theme and it's emacs port i guess.
